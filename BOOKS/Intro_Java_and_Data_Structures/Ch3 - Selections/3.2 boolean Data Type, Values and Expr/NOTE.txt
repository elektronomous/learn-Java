Java provides six relational operators (also known as comparison operators), 
shown in Table 3.1, which can be used to compare two values (assume radius is 5
in the table).


Java Operator       Mathematics Symbol  Name                        Example (radius is 5)   Result
<                   <                   Less than                   radius < 0              false
<=                  ≤                   Less than or equal to       radius <= 0             false
>                   >                   Greater than                radius > 0              true
>=                  ≥                   Greater than or equal to    radius >= 0             true
==                  =                   Equal to                    radius == 0             false
!=                  ≠                   Not equal to                radius != 0             true

The result of the comparison is a Boolean value: true or false

A variable that holds a Boolean value is known as a Boolean variable. The boolean
data type is used to declare Boolean variables. A boolean variable can hold one of the two
values: true or false. 

        boolean lightsOn = true;

true and false are literals, just like a number such as 10. They are not keywords, but are
reserved words and cannot be used as identifiers in the program.

Suppose you want to develop a program to let a first-grader practice addition. The program
randomly generates two single-digit integers, number1 and number2, and displays to the
student a question such as “What is 1 + 7?, ” as shown in the sample run in Listing 3.1. After
the student types the answer, the program displays a message to indicate whether it is true or
false.
