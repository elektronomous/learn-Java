A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.
A leap year has 366 days. The February of a leap year has 29 days. You can use the following
Boolean expressions to check whether a year is a leap year:

    // A leap year is divisible by 4
    boolean isLeapYear = (year % 4 == 0);

    // A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100
    isLeapYear = isLeapYear && (year % 100 != 0)

    // A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or divisible by 400
    isLeapYear = isLeapYear || (year % 400 == 0);

Or you can combine all these expressions into one as follows:

    isLeapYear = (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)
