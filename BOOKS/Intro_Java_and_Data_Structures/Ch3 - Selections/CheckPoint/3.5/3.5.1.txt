Suppose x = 3 and y = 2; show the output, if any, of the following code. What
is the output if x = 3 and y = 4? What is the output if x = 2 and y = 2? Draw
a flowchart of the code.

        if (x > 2) {
            if (y > 2) {
                z = x + y;
                System.out.println("z is " + z);
            }
        }
        else
            System.out.println("x is " + x);

(answer):

- x = 3 & y = 2;
  = It doesn't show any output since the because the second boolean expression
    is failed.

- x = 3 and y = 4
  = It display the result of z:
    "z is 7"

- x = 2 & y = 2
  = It display the "x is 2" because the first boolean expression is result false.
