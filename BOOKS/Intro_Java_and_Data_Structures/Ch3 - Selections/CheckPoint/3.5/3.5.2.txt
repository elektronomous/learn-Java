Suppose x = 2 and y = 3. Show the output, if any, of the following code. What is
the output if x = 3 and y = 2? What is the output if x = 3 and y = 3?

        if (x > 2)
            if (y > 2) {
                int z = x + y;
                System.out.println("z is " + z);
            } 
        else
            System.out.println("x is " + x);

(answer):

- x = 2 & y = 3
  = Since the first boolean expression is false, then the output result will be:
    "x is 2"

- x = 3 & y = 2
  = It doesn't show any output because the boolean expression when evaluating
    y's value result in false.

- x = 3 & y = 3
  = It shows the result of z "z is 6"
