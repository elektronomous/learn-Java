What is y after the following switch statement is executed? Rewrite the code 
using an if-else statement.

        x = 3; y = 3;

        switch (x + 3) {
            case 6: y = 1;
            default: y += 1; 
        }

(answer):
= y would be assigned 1

=       if (x + y)
            y = 1;
        else
            y += 1;
