What data types are required for a switch variable? If the keyword break is not 
used after a case is processed, what is the next statement to be executed? Can you 
convert a switch statement to an equivalent if statement, or vice versa? What are 
the advantages of using a switch statement?

(answer):
= The data types are short, int, String, char, and byte
= The next statement is the case after the matched-case
= It could be converted, the advantage using switch is that we avoid the overuse of
  using the if-else statement which make the code ugly.
