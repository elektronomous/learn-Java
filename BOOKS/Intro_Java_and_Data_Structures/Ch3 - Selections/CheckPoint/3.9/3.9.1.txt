Are the following two statements equivalent?

        if (income <= 10000)
            tax = income * 0.1;
        else if (income <= 20000)
            tax = 1000 + (income − 10000) * 0.15;
        
        if (income <= 10000)
            tax = income * 0.1;
        else if (income > 10000 && income <= 20000)
            tax = 1000 + (income − 10000) * 0.15;
