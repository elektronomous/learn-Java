An if-else statement decides the execution path based on whether the condition is
true or false
A one-way if statement performs an action if the specified condition is true. If
the condition is false, nothing is done. But what if you want to take alternative
actions when the condition is false? You can use a two-way if-else statement. 

        if (boolean-expression) {
            statement(s)-for-the-true-case;
        } 
        else {
            statement(s)-for-the-false-case;
        }

If the boolean-expression evaluates to true, the statement(s) for the true case are
executed; otherwise, the statement(s) for the false case are executed. 

        if (radius >= 0) {
            area = radius * radius * PI;
            System.out.println("The area for the circle of radius " +
            radius + " is " + area);
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Negative input");
        }

If radius >= 0 is true, area is computed and displayed; if it is false, the message
"Negative input" is displayed.
