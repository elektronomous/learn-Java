If you enter a negative value for radius in Listing 2.2, ComputeAreaWithConsoleInput.java,
the program displays an invalid result. If the radius is negative, you don’t want 
the program to compute the area. How can you deal with this situation?
Like all high-level programming languages, Java provides selection statements: 
statements that let you choose actions with alternative courses. You can use
the following selection statement to replace lines 12–17 in Listing 2.2:

        if (radius < 0) {
            System.out.println("Inccorect input");
        } else {
            double area = radius * radius * 3.14159;
            System.out.println("Area is " + area);
        }

Selection statements use conditions that are Boolean expressions. A Boolean
expression is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value: true or false.
