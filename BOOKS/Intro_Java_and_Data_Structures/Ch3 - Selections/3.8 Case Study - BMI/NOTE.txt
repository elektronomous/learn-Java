Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of health based on height and weight. 
It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it 
by the square of your height in meters. The interpretation of BMI for 
people 20 years or older is as follows:

        BMI                     INTERPRETATION
        ---                     --------------
        BMI < 18.5                Underweight
        18.5 <= BMI < 25.0        Normal
        25.0 <= BMI < 30.0        Overweight
        30.0 <= BMI               Obese
