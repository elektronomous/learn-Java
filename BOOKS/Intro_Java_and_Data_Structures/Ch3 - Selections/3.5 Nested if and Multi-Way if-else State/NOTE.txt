The inner if statement is said to be nested inside the outer if 
statement. The inner if statement can contain another if statement;
in fact, there is no limit to the depth of the nesting. 

        if (i > k) {
            if (j > k)
                System.out.println("i and j are greater than k");
        }
        else
            System.out.println("i is less than or equal to k");

The nested if statement can be used to implement multiple alternatives. 
The statement given in Figure 3.3a, for instance, prints a letter grade
according to the score, with multiple alternatives.

        if (score >= 90)                                                    if (score >= 90)
            System.out.print("A");                                              System.out.print("A");
        else                                                                else if (score >= 80)
            if (score >= 80)                                                    System.out.print("B");
                System.out.print("B");                                      else if (score >= 70)
            else                                                                System.out.print("C");
                if (score >= 70)                ===== Equivalent ======     else if (score >= 60)
                    System.out.print("C");                                      System.out.print("D");
                else                                                        else
                    if (score >= 60)                                            System.out.print("F");
                        System.out.print("D");
                    else
                        System.out.print("F");
            
                    (a)                                                         (b) This is better

The first condition (score >= 90) is tested. If it is true, the grade is A.
If it is false, the second condition (score >= 80) is tested. If the second
condition is true, the grade is B. If that condition is false, the third
condition and the rest of the conditions (if necessary) are tested until a 
condition is met or all of the conditions prove to be false. If all of the
conditions are false, the grade is F. Note a condition is tested only when
all of the conditions that come before it are false.

In fact, Figure 3.3b is the preferred coding style for multiple alternative
if statements. This style, called multi-way if-else statements, avoids deep
indentation and makes the program easy to read.
