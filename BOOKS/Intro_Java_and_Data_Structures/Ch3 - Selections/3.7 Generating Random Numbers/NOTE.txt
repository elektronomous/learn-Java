You can use Math.random() to obtain a random double value between 0.0 and 1.0,
excluding 1.0.Invoking this method returns a random double value d such that 
0.0 <= d < 1.0. Thus, (int)(Math.random() * 10) returns a random single-digit
integer (i.e., a number between 0 and 9).

Suppose you want to develop a program for a first-grader to practice subtraction. 
The program randomly generates two single-digit integers, number1 and number2, with number1
>= number2, and it displays to the student a question such as “What is 9 - 2?” After the
student enters the answer, the program displays a message indicating whether it is correct.
