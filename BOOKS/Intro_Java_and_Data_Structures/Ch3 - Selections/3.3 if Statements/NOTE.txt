Java has several types of selection statements: one-way if statements, two-way if-else
statements, nested if statements, multi-way if-else statements, switch statements, and
conditional operators

A one-way if statement executes an action if and only if the condition is true. The syntax
for a one-way if statement is as follows:
    
        if (boolean-expression) {
            statement(s);
        }
