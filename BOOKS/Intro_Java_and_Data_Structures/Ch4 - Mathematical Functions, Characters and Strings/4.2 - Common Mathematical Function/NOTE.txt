A method is a group of statements that performs a specific task. You have already used the pow(a,b) method
to compute aᵇ in Section 2.9.4, Exponent Operations and the random() method for generating a random number
in Section 3.7. This section introduces other useful methods in the Math class. They can be categorized as
trigonometric methods, exponent methods, and service methods. Service methods include the rounding, min, 
max, absolute, and random methods. In addition to methods, the Math class provides two useful double constants,
PI and E (the base of natural logarithms). You can use these constants as Math.PI and Math.E in any program.

TRIGONOMETRI METHODS (Trogonometry-table.PNG)
The Math class contains the following methods as listed in Table 4.1 for performing trigonometric functions:
    Method          Description
sin(radians)        Returns the trigonometric sine of an angle in radians.
cos(radians)        Returns the trigonometric cosine of an angle in radians.
tan(radians)        Returns the trigonometric tangent of an angle in radians.
toRadians(degree)   Returns the angle in radians for the angle in degrees.
toDegrees(radians)  Returns the angle in degrees for the angle in radians.
asin(a)             Returns the angle in radians for the inverse of sine.
acos(a)             Returns the angle in radians for the inverse of cosine.
atan(a)             Returns the angle in radians for the inverse of tangent.

for example: 
    Math.toDegrees(Math.PI / 2) returns 90.0
    Math.toRadians(30) returns 0.5236 (same as π/6)
    Math.sin(0) returns 0.0
    Math.sin(Math.toRadians(270)) returns -1.0
    Math.sin(Math.PI / 6) returns 0.5
    Math.sin(Math.PI / 2) returns 1.0
    Math.cos(0) returns 1.0
    Math.cos(Math.PI / 6) returns 0.866 or √3/2
    Math.cos(Math.PI / 2) returns 0.0

EXPONENT METHODS
There are five methods related to exponents in the Math class as listed in Table 4.2.:
Method      Description
exp(x)      Returns e raised to power of x (eˣ).
log(x)      Returns the natural logarithm of x (ln(x) = logₑ(x)).
log10(x)    Returns the base 10 logarithm of x (log₁₀(x)).
pow(a, b)   Returns a raised to the power of b (aᵇ).
sqrt(x)     Returns the square root of x (√x) for x >= 0.

for example:
    e³.⁵        is Math.exp(3.5), which returns 33.11545
    ln(3.5)     is Math. log(3.5), which returns 1.25276
    log₁₀ (3.5) is Math.log10(3.5), which returns 0.544
    2³          is Math.pow(2,3), which returns 8.0
    3²          is Math.pow(3,2), which returns 9.0 
    √4          is Math.sqrt(4), which returns 2.0

THE ROUNDING METHODS
The Math class contains four rounding methods as listed in Table 4.3:
Method      Description
ceil(x)     x is rounded up to its nearest integer. This integer is returned as a double value.
floor(x)    x is rounded down to its nearest integer. This integer is returned as a double value.
rint(x)     x is rounded to its nearest integer. If x is equally close to two integers, the even one is returned as a double value.
round(x)    Returns (int)Math.floor(x + 0.5) if x is a float and returns (long)Math.floor(x + 0.5) if x is a double.
