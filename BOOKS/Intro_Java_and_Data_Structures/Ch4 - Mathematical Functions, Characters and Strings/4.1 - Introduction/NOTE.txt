The focus of this chapter is to introduce mathematical functions, characters, string objects, and use them to develop
programs.
Suppose you need to estimate the area enclosed by four cities, given the GPS locations (latitude and longitude) of
these cities, as shown in the following diagram. How would you write a program to solve this problem? You will be able
to write such a program in this chapter.
