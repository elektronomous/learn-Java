The OS manages and controls a computer’s activities.
The major tasks of an operating system are as follows:
    ■■ Controlling and monitoring system activities
    ■■ Allocating and assigning system resources
    ■■ Scheduling operations

Operating systems perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from the keyboard, sending
output to the monitor, keeping track of files and folders on storage devices, and controlling
peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

The operating system is responsible for determining what computer resources a program
needs (such as CPU time, memory space, disks, and input and output devices) and for allocating
and assigning them to run the program.

The OS is responsible for scheduling programs’ activities to make efficient use of system
resources.

Multiprogramming allows multiple programs such as Microsoft Word, E-mail, and web browser to
run simultaneously by sharing the same CPU. The CPU is much faster than the computer’s other
components. As a result, it is idle most of the time—for example, while waiting for data to be
transferred from a disk or waiting for other system resources to respond. A multiprogramming OS
takes advantage of this situation by allowing multiple programs to use the CPU when it would 
otherwise be idle. For example, multiprogramming enables you to use a word processor to edit a
file at the same time as your web browser is downloading a file.

Multithreading allows a single program to execute multiple tasks at the same time. For
instance, a word-processing program allows users to simultaneously edit text and save it to a
disk. In this example, editing and saving are two tasks within the same program. These two
tasks may run concurrently.

Multiprocessing is similar to multithreading. The difference is that multithreading is for
running multithreads concurrently within one program, but multiprocessing is for running
multiple programs concurrently using multiple processors.
