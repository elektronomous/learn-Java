high-level languages emerged. They are platform independent, which means that 
you can write a program in a high-level language and run it in different types
of machines. The instructions in a high-level programming language are called
statements. Here, for example, is a high-level language statement that computes 
the area of a circle with a radius of 5:
        
        area = 5 * 5 * 3.14159;

A program written in a high-level language is called a source program or source code.
Because a computer cannot execute a source program, a source program must be translated
into machine code for execution. The translation can be done using another programming tool
called an interpreter or a compiler.

        ■■ An interpreter reads one statement from the source code, translates it to the machine
           code or virtual machine code, then executes it right away, as shown in Figure 1.4a. Note
           a statement from the source code may be translated into several machine instructions.
                
    ( area = 5 * 5 * 3.14159; ) ------> | INTERPRETER | ------> Output
                
        ■■ A compiler translates the entire source code into a machine-code file, and the machine-
           code file is then executed, as shown in Figure 1.4b.

    ( area = 5 * 5 * 3.14159; ) ------> | COMPILER | ------> (01011000110111001111001010) ------> Output
