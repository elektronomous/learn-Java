A computer’s native language, which differs among different types of computers, is its
machine language—a set of built-in primitive instructions. These instructions are in the
form of binary code, so if you want to give a computer an instruction in its native 
language, you have to enter the instruction as binary code. For example, to add two 
numbers, you might have to write an instruction in binary code as follows:
    
    1101101010011010
