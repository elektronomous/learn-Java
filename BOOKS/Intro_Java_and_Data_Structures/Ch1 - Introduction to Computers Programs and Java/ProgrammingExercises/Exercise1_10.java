/* (Average speed in miles) Assume that a runner runs 14 kilometers in
 * 45 minutes and 30 seconds. Write a program that displays the average
 * speed in miles per hour. (Note 1 mile is equal to 1.6 Kilometers)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * to get your grasp:
 * 1 minute = 60 seconds
 * n minute = 30 seconds
 * n minute = 30 / 60 = 0.5 minutes
 * 
 * 1 hour = 60 minutes
 * n hour = 45,5 minutes
 * n hour = 45,5 / 60 = 0,76 hours
 * 
 * miles = 14 kilometers / 1.6 kilometer = 8,75 miles
 *
