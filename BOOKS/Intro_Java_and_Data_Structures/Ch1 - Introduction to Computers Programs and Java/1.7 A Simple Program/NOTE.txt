The word console is an old computer term that refers to the text entry and
display device of a computer. Console input means to receive input from the keyboard, and
console output means to display output on the monitor.

Welcome.java:
By convention, class names start with an uppercase letter.
A class may contain several methods. The main method is the entry point where the program
begins execution.
In Java, comments are preceded by two slashes (//) on a line, called a line comment, or 
enclosed between /* and */ on one or several lines, called a block comment or paragraph
comment.
Every class has a class block that groups the data and methods of the class. Similarly, 
every method has a method block that groups the statements in the method. Blocks can be
nested, meaning that one block can be placed within another, as shown in the following code:

        public class Welcome { -----------------------------------|
            public static void main(String[] args) { -------      |
                System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");    |      |
            } ----------------------------------------------      |
        } --------------------------------------------------------|
