Are tools like NetBeans and Eclipse different language from Java, or
are they dialects or extensions of Java?

(answer):
= NetBeans and Eclipse are not programming language, instead it's a environment
  where you can write your Java code (or another programming language's code) 
  and then use their feature to ease your job when building a program.
