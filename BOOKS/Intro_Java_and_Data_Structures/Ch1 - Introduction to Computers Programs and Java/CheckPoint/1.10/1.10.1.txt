What are syntax errors (compile errors), runtime errors and logic errors?

(answer):
= Syntax error is an error when you write a code and not followed the compile
  rules. Like missing semicolon(;) at the end of a statement, not close the open
  bracket, not close the double string, misspeled the keyword and so on. 
= runtime error is an error where the program can't continue the operation. It
  stops the program from running. For example, when you enter a value that's not
  expected, or when you doing arithmetic operation like division by zero
= logic error is an error where the program you design isn't work like the way you
  intended. for example, 3 * 7 + 3 you expect it the result would be 30, but that's
  wrong because in arithmetic operation, the multiplication operation would be 
  evaluated first, so the true result would be 24.
