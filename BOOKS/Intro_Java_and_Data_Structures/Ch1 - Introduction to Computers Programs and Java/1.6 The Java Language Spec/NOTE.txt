The JDK is the software for compiling and running Java programs.

The Java language specification is a technical definition of the Java programming
language’s syntax and semantics. You can find the complete Java language specification at
docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/.

The application program interface (API), also known as library, contains predefined
classes and interfaces for developing Java programs. The API is still expanding. You can
view the latest Java API documentation at https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/.

Java is a full-fledged and powerful language that can be used in many ways. It comes in
three editions:
        ■■ Java Standard Edition (Java SE) to develop client-side applications. The applications
           can run on desktop.
        ■■ Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to develop server-side applications, such as Java
           servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF).
        ■■ Java Micro Edition (Java ME) to develop applications for mobile devices, such as
           cell phones.

The JDK consists of a set of separate programs, each invoked from a command line, for
compiling, running, and testing Java programs. The program for running Java programs is
known as Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
