A computer’s memory consists of an ordered sequence of bytes for storing programs as well
as data with which the program is working. You can think of memory as the computer’s work
area for executing a program. A program and its data must be moved into the computer’s
memory before they can be executed by the CPU.

Every byte in the memory has a unique address, as shown in Figure 1.2. The address is used
to locate the byte for storing and retrieving the data. Since the bytes in the memory can
be accessed in any order, the memory is also referred to as random-access memory (RAM).
