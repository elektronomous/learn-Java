It retrieves instructions from the memory and executes them. The CPU usually 
has two components: a control unit and an arithmetic/logic unit. The control
unit controls and coordinates the actions of the other components. The 
arithmetic/logic unit performs numeric operations (addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division) and logical operations (comparisons).

Every computer has an internal clock that emits electronic pulses at a 
constant rate. These pulses are used to control and synchronize the pace of
operations. A higher clock speed enables more instructions to be executed in a
given period of time. The unit of measurement of clock speed is the hertz (Hz),
with 1 Hz equaling 1 pulse per second. the clock speed of a computer is now 
usually stated in gigahertz (GHz, i.e., 1 billion pulses per second). Intel’s 
newest processors run at about 3 GHz.

The core is the part of the processor that performs the reading and executing
of instructions. Today’s consumer computers typically have two, four, and even
eight separate cores. Soon, CPUs with dozens or even hundreds of cores will be
affordable.
