A computer’s memory (RAM) is a volatile form of data storage: Any information that has
been saved in memory is lost when the system’s power is turned off. Programs and data are
permanently stored on storage devices and are moved, when the computer actually uses them,
to memory, which operates at much faster speeds than permanent storage devices can.

Drives are devices for operating a medium, such as disks and CDs. A storage medium
physically stores data and program instructions. The drive reads data from the medium and
writes data onto the medium.
