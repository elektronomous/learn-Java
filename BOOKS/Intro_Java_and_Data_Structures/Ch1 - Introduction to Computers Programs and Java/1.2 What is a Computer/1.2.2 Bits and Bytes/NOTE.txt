A computer is really nothing more than a series of switches. Each switch exists in two
states: on or off. If the switch is on, its value is 1. If the switch is off, its value
is 0. These 0s and 1s are interpreted as digits in the binary number system and are
called bits (binary digits).

The minimum storage unit in a computer is a byte. A byte is composed of eight bits. A
small number such as 3 can be stored as a single byte.

Data of various kinds, such as numbers and characters, are encoded as a series of bytes.
An encoding scheme is a set of rules that govern how a computer translates characters 
and numbers into data (Bytes) with which the computer can actually work. Most schemes 
translate each character into a predetermined string of bits. In the popular ASCII 
encoding scheme, for example, the character C is represented as 01000011 in 1 byte.
