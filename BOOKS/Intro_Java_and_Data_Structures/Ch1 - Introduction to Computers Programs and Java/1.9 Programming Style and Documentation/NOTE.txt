Programming style deals with what programs look like. A program can compile and run
properly even if written on only one line, but writing it all on one line would be a
bad programming style because it would be hard to read. Documentation is the body of
explanatory remarks (ucapan) and comments pertaining (berkaitan) to a program.

Java supports comments of a special type, referred to as javadoc comments. javadoc 
comments begin with /** and end with */. They can be extracted into an HTML file using
the JDKâ€™s javadoc command. For more information, see Supplement III.X, javadoc Comments,
on the Companion Website. Use javadoc comments (/** . . . */) for commenting on an 
entire class or an entire method. These comments must precede the class or the method 
header in order to be extracted into a javadoc HTML file. For commenting on steps inside
a method, use line comments (//). To see an example of a javadoc HTML file, check out 
liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/javadoc/Exercise1.html. Its corresponding Java code is shown
in liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/javadoc/Exercise1.txt.
