Java is a powerful and versatile programming language for developing software running
on mobile devices, desktop computers, and servers.

Java was developed by a team led by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. Originally 
called Oak, Java was designed in 1991 for use in embedded chips in consumer electronic
appliances. In 1995, renamed Java, it was redesigned for developing web  applications.

Java initially became attractive because Java programs can run from a web browser. Such
programs are called applets. Today applets are no longer allowed to run from a Web browser
due to security issues.
