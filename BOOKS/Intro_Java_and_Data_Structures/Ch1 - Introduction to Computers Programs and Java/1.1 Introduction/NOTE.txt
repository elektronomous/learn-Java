The term programming means to create (or develop) software, which is also called a 
program. In basic terms, software contains instructions that tell a computer—or a 
computerized device—what to do.

Each language was invented for a specific purpose—to build on the strengths of a 
previous language, for example, or to give the programmer a new and unique set of tools.
