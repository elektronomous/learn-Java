After a variable is declared, you can assign a value to it by using an assignment statement. In
Java, the equal sign (=) is used as the assignment operator. The syntax for assignment statements
is as follows:

        variable = expression;

An expression represents a computation involving values, variables, and operators that,
taking them together, evaluates to a value. In an assignment statement, the expression on the
right-hand side of the assignment operator is evaluated, and then the value is assigned to the
variable on the left-hand side of the assignment operator. For example, consider the following
code:

        int y = 1;              // assign 1 to variable you
        int x = 5 * (3 / 2);    // Assign 1.0 to variable radius

You can use a variable in an expression. A variable can also be used in both sides of the =
operator. For example,

        x = x + 1;

In this assignment statement, the result of x + 1 is assigned to x. If x is 1 before the statement
is executed, then it becomes 2 after the statement is executed. To assign a value to a variable, 
you must place the variable name to the left of the assignment operator. Thus, the following 
statement is wrong:
        
        1 = x; // Wrong

In Java, an assignment statement is essentially an expression that evaluates to the value
to be assigned to the variable on the left side of the assignment operator. For this reason, an
assignment statement is also known as an assignment expression. For example, the following
statement is correct:

        System.out.println(x = 1);

Which is equivalent to:

        x = 1;
        System.out.println(x);

If a value is assigned to multiple variables, you can use chained assignments like this:
        
        i = j = k = 1;

which is equivalent to
        
        k = 1;
        j = k;
        i = j;
