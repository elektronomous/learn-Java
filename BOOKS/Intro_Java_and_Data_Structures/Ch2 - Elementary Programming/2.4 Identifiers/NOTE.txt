Identifiers are the names that identify the elements such as classes, methods, and 
variables in a program.  All identifiers must obey the following rules:
        ■■ An identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits, 
           underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
        ■■ An identifier must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
           It cannot start with a digit.
        ■■ An identifier cannot be a reserved word. See Appendix A for a list of reserved
           words. Reserved words have specific meaning in the Java language. Keywords are
           reserved words.
        ■■ An identifier can be of any length.
