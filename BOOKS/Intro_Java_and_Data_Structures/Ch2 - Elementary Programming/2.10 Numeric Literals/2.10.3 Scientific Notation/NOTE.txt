Floating-point literals can be written in scientific notation in 
the form of a * 10^b. For example, the scientific notation for 
123.456 is 1.23456 * 10^2 and for 0.0123456 is 1.23456 * 10^-2. A
special syntax is used to write scientific notation numbers. 
For example, 1.23456 * 102 is written as 1.23456E2 or 
1.23456E+2 and 1.23456 * 10^-2 as 1.23456E-2. E (or e) represents
an exponent, and can be in either lowercase or uppercase.
