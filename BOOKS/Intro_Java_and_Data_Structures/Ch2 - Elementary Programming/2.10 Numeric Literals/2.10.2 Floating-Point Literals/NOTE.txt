Floating-point literals are written with a decimal point. By default,
a floating-point literal is treated as a double type value. For example,
5.0 is considered a double value, not a float value.

You can make a number a float by appending the letter f or F, and you 
can make a number a double by appending the letter d or D. For example,
you can use 100.2f or 100.2F for a float number, and 100.2d or 100.2D
for a double number.

To improve readability, Java allows you to use underscores to separate 
two digits in a number literal. For example, the following literals are
correct.

        long value = 232_45_4519;
        double amount = 23.24_4545_4519_3415;

However, 45_ or _45 is incorrect. The underscore must be placed between 
two digits.
