What are the benefits of using constants? Declare an int constant SIZE with
value 20.

(answer):
= You don't type the value of the constant repeatedly
= When you want to change the constant, you change its value only once
= Descriptive constant value's name would make the program easier to
  understand

        final int SIZE = 20;
