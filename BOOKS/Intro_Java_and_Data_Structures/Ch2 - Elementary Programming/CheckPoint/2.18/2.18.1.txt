Show the output of Listing 2.10 with the input value 1.99. Why does the
program produce an incorrect result for the input 10.03?

(answer):
= Enter an amount in double, for example 11.56: 1.99
    Your amount 1.99 consists of
    1 dollars
    3 quarters
    2 dimes
    0 nickels
    4 pennies

= If you add an output after you multiply the amount of dollars, then the result
  the program gives us is 1002
