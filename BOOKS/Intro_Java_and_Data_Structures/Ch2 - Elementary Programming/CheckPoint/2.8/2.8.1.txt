What are the naming conventions for class names, method names, constants and
variables? Which of the following items can be a constant, a method, a variable
or a class according to the Java naming conventions?

        MAX_VALUE, Test, read, readDouble

(answer):

= The first letter of each word of the class names should be capitalized.
= method and variables names the first letter of the word should be lowercase, then
  the subsequent word's first letter should be uppercase and the subsequent word
  should be concatenated to the first word.
= each letter of the constant namming conventions are uppercase.

MAX_VALUE => constant
Test => class
read => variable or method
readDouble => variable or method
