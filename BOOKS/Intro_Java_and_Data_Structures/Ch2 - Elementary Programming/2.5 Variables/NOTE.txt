Variables are used to represent values that may be changed in the program.
The variable declaration tells the compiler to allocate appropriate memory
space for the variable based on its data type. The syntax for declaring a
variable is:

        datatype variableName;

Here are some examples of variable declarations:

        int count;              // Declare count to be an integer variable
        double radius;          // Declare radius to be a double variable
        double interestRate;    // Declare interestRate to be a double variable

If variables are of the same type, they can be declared together, as follows:
        
        datatype variable1, variable2, . . . , variablen;

Variables often have initial values. You can declare a variable and initialize it in one step.
Consider, for instance, the following code:
        
        int count = 1;

This is equivalent to the next two statements:

        int count;
        count = 1;

You can also use a shorthand form to declare and initialize variables of the same type together.
For example,
        
        int i = 1, j = 2;

Whenever possible, declare a variable and assign its initial value in one step. This will
make the program easy to read and avoid programming errors.
