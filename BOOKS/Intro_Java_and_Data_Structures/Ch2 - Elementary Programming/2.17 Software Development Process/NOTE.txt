Software products, no matter how large or how small, have the same life 
cycle: requirements specification, analysis, design, implementation, 
       testing, deployment, and maintenance

Requirements specification is a formal process that seeks to understand the problem the
software will address, and to document in detail what the software system needs to do. This
phase involves close interaction between users and developers.

System analysis seeks to analyze the data flow and to identify the system’s input and output.
When you perform analysis, it helps to identify what the output is first, then figure out what
input data you need in order to produce the output.

System design is to design a process for obtaining the output from the input. This phase
involves the use of many levels of abstraction to break down the problem into manageable
components and design strategies for implementing each component. 

Implementation involves translating the system design into programs. Separate programs
are written for each component then integrated to work together. This phase requires the use
of a programming language such as Java. The implementation involves coding, self-testing,
and debugging (that is, finding errors, called bugs, in the code)

Testing ensures the code meets the requirements specification and weeds out bugs. An
independent team of software engineers not involved in the design and implementation of the
product usually conducts such testing

Deployment makes the software available for use. Depending on the type of software,
it may be installed on each user’s machine, or installed on a server accessible on the
Internet.

Maintenance is concerned with updating and improving the product. A software product
must continue to perform and improve in an ever-evolving environment. 
This requires periodic upgrades of the product to fix newly discovered bugs and incorporate
changes.
