There are no spaces in the augmented assignment operators. For example, + = should be +=.

Like the assignment operator (=), the operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, and %=) can be used
to form an assignment statement as well as an expression. For example, in the following
code, x += 2 is a statement in the first line, and an expression in the second line:

        x += 2;                     // Statement
        System.out.println(x += 2); // Expression
