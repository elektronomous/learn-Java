Here are the steps in developing the program:
        1. Prompt the user to enter the amount as a decimal number, such as 11.56.
        2. Convert the amount (e.g., 11.56) into cents (1156).
        3. Divide the cents by 100 to find the number of dollars. Obtain the remaining cents using
           the cents remainder 100.
        4. Divide the remaining cents by 25 to find the number of quarters. Obtain the remaining
           cents using the remaining cents remainder 25.
        5. Divide the remaining cents by 10 to find the number of dimes. Obtain the remaining
           cents using the remaining cents remainder 10.
        6. Divide the remaining cents by 5 to find the number of nickels. Obtain the remaining
           cents using the remaining cents remainder 5.
        7. The remaining cents are the pennies.
        8. Display the result.
