You can invoke System.currentTimeMillis() to return the current time.
The problem is to develop a program that displays the current time in
GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) in the format hour:minute:second, such as 
13:19:8. The currentTimeMillis method in the System class returns the
current time in milliseconds elapsed since the time midnight, January 
1, 1970 GMT, as shown in Figure 2.8. This time is known as the UNIX 
epoch. The epoch is the point when time starts, and 1970 was the year
when the UNIX operating system was formally introduced.

You can use this method to obtain the current time, then compute the current second, minute,
and hour as follows:
   
    1. Obtain the total milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970, in totalMilliseconds
       by invoking System.currentTimeMillis() (e.g., 1203183068328 milliseconds).
    2. Obtain the total seconds totalSeconds by dividing totalMilliseconds by 1000
       (e.g., 1203183068328 milliseconds / 1000 = 1203183068 seconds).
    3. Compute the current second from totalSeconds % 60 (e.g., 1203183068 seconds %
       60 = 8, which is the current second).
    4. Obtain the total minutes totalMinutes by dividing totalSeconds by 60 (e.g.,
       1203183068 seconds / 60 = 20053051 minutes).
    5. Compute the current minute from totalMinutes % 60 (e.g., 20053051 minutes % 60
       = 31, which is the current minute).
    6. Obtain the total hours totalHours by dividing totalMinutes by 60 (e.g., 20053051
       minutes / 60 = 334217 hours).
    7. Compute the current hour from totalHours % 24 (e.g., 334217 hours % 24 = 17,
       which is the current hour).
