JShell enables you to type a single Java statement and get it executed to 
see the result right away without having to write a complete class. This 
feature is commonly known as REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), which 
evaluates expressions and executes statements as they are entered and 
shows the result immediately.

You can list all the declared variables using the /vars command as shown 
in Figure 2.5.

You can use the /edit command to edit the code you have entered from the
jshell prompt, as shown in Figure 2.6a. This command opens up an edit pane.

In JShell, if you donâ€™t specify a variable for a value, JShell will 
automatically create a variable for the value. For example, if you type 
6.8 from the jshell prompt, you will see variable $7 is automatically 
created for 6.8, as shown in Figure 2.7.
