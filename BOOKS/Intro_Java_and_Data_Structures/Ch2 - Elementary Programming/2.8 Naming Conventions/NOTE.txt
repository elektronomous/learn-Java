Listed below are the conventions for naming variables, methods, and classes.

        ■■ Use lowercase for variables and methods—for example, the variables radius and
           area, and the method print. If a name consists of several words, concatenate them
           into one, making the first word lowercase and capitalizing the first letter of each subsequent
           word—for example, the variable numberOfStudents. This naming style is
           known as the camelCase because the uppercase characters in the name resemble a
           camel’s humps.
        ■■ Capitalize the first letter of each word in a class name—for example, the class names
           ComputeArea and System.
        ■■ Capitalize every letter in a constant, and use underscores between words—for example,
           the constants PI and MAX_VALUE.
