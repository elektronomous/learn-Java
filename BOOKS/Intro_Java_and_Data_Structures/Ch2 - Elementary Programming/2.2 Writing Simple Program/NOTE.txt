An algorithm lists the steps you can follow to solve a problem. Algorithms can be described
in natural languages or in pseudocode (natural language mixed with some programming code).

The algorithm for calculating the area of a circle can be described as follows:
        1. Read in the circle’s radius.
        2. Compute the area using the following formula:
                
                area = radius * radius * p
        
        3. Display the result.

You already know every Java program begins with a class definition in which the
keyword class is followed by the class name. Assume you have chosen ComputeArea as
the class name. The outline of the program would look as follows:

        public class ComputeArea {
            // Details to be given later
        }

As you know, every Java program must have a main method where program execution
begins. The program is then expanded as follows:

        public class ComputeArea {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                // Step 1: Read in radius

                // Step 2: Compute Area

                // Step 3: Display the area
            }
        }

The program needs to read the radius entered by the user from the keyboard. This raises
two important issues:

        ■■ Reading the radius
        ■■ Storing the radius in the program

Let’s address the second issue first. In order to store the radius, the program needs to 
declare a symbol called a variable. A variable represents a value stored in the computer’s 
memory. choose descriptive names: in this case, radius for radius and area for area. To let
the compiler know what radius and area are, specify their data types. That is the kind of 
data stored in a variable, whether an integer, real number, or something else. This is known
as declaring variables. Java provides simple data types for representing integers, real 
numbers, characters, and Boolean types. These types are known as primitive data types or 
fundamental types.

Declare radius and area as double. The program can be expanded as follows:

        public class ComputeArea {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                double radius;      // Declare radius as double
                double area;        // Declare area as double 

                // Assign a radius
                radius = 20;        // radius now 20

                // Compute Area
                area = radius * radius * 3.14159;

                // Display results
                System.out.println("The area for the circle of radius " +
                                    radius + " is " + area);
            }
        }
    
The plus sign (+) has two meanings: one for addition, and the other for concatenating
(combining) strings. The plus sign (+) in lines 13–14 is called a string concatenation 
operator. It combines two strings into one. If a string is combined with a number, the 
number is converted into a string and concatenated with the other string.
