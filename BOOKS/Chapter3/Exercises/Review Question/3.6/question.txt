1. Suppose that a program consists of two files: BallpointPen.java contains the declara-
   tion of the BallpointPen class and WriteLetter.java contains a program that creates
   BallpointPen objects. What single command would compile both files?

= javac WriteLetter.java

2. What command would we use to execute the program described in Question1?
= java WriteLetter

3. Suppose that a program consits of more than one class. Which practice is usually better:
   putting all class in one file, or putting each class in a seperate file?
= putting each class in a seperate file.
