1. Locate the error in the following comment and show how to fix it.
    /* CSc 2310
       Program 1: Basic interpreter
       Author: Billy Gates /*

= This is a multiline comment which start with /* and */, to fix the error
  of above comment you just change the /* to */

2. How many tokens does the Lottery program (Section 2.4) contain?
= 53

3. In each part below, locate the error and show how to fix it
   (a) int a = b = 0;
=  int a, b = 0;

   (b) int i = 1;
       int j = i + 2, k = i + 3;
       int i = j + k; 
=   remove the type of the i of the last initialization
       i = j + k;

4. Locate the error in each of the following declarations and show how to fix it.
   (a) double speedOfLight = 299,792,458.0;
=  to create an integer that's thousand we don't insert a comma to seperate them, instead
   underscore
       double speedOfLight = 299_792_458.0;
   
   (b) double phi = 3.1459e;
= e(exponent) always followed by a number
       double phi = 3.1459e0;

5. Which one of the following double literals is not equivalent to the others ?
   (a) 1.23e+1
   (b) 123.0e-3
   (c) 0.0123e3
   (d) 12.3e0
= (b) 123 x 10^-3 = 0.123

6. Locate the error in each of the following declartions and show how to fix it.
   (a) int students = 30, teacher = 1, class;
= class is a keyword in java, you should remove the class identifier/using another identifier
       int students = 30, teacher = 1, classValue = 1;

   (b) double total-balance = 0, depositsFor2000;
= identifier only allow to use _(underscore) not dash.
       double total_balance = 0, depositsFor2000;

   (c) double expenses, net_profit, 2001revenues;
= identifier always start with letter, not a number. this easies the Java to recognize that's a number,
  not a identifier/variable
       double expenses, net_profit, _2001revenues;

7. Give the value and type(int or double) of each of the following expressions
   (a) -1 + -4.5
= double result = -1 + -4.5;
   (b) 4 - 5 - 6
= int result = 4 - 5 - 6;
   (c) 13 / 2 * 2.0
= double result = 13 / 2 * 2.0;
   (d) 1 % 2 + 3 % 2
= int result = 1 % 2 + 3 % 2
   (e) 5 % 6 % 7
= int result = 5 % 6 % 7

8. Add parentheses to the following expressions to indicate how Java will interpret them. (An expression that contains
   expression that contains n operator will need n - 1 sets of parentheses)
   (a) a + - + b + - d
= (a + (-(+b))) + (-d)
   (b) a / b / c * d * e
= (((a / b) / c) * d) * e
   (c) a + b - c + d
= ((a + b) - c)
   (d) a * b / c % d + e
= (((a * b) / c) % d) + e
   (e) - a - b - c - d
= (((-a) - b) - c) - d

9. What is the output of the following program ? 
    public class Exercise2_9 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int d1 = 11;
            int d4 = d1 % 2;
            d1 /= 2;
            int d3 = d1 % 2;
            d1 /= 2;
            int d2 = d1 % 2;
            d1 /= 2;

            System.out.println("Answer: " + d1 + d2 + d3 + d4);
        }
    }

= 1011

10. Shows the output of the following statement:
    System.out.println("\"a\n\\b\"");
= To make it simple, just seperate them
    System.out.println(" \" a\n \\ b \" ");
    "a
    \b"

11. Locate the error in each of the following statements and show how to fix it.
    (a) System.out.println("Java directory: C:\JDK1.2");
= You should escape the \ after C:
        System.out.println("Java directory: C:\\JDK1.2");

   (b) System.out.println("\"\\\");
= seperate them to make you easier when analysing the 
  (" \" \ \ \")
  the backslash before the end of the quote was the problem
       System.out.println("\"\\\\");

   (c) System.out.println("Who is this"Wisnovsky," anyway?");
= escaping the quotes 
       System.out.println("Whos is this \"Wisnovsky,\" anyway?");

12. Lines 110 and 111 of the CourseAverage.java program could be simplified further. Instead
    of 
            .30 * programAverage * 5
    we could write
            1.50 * programAverage.
    The expression
            .10 * quizAverage * 10 
    could be replaced by
            quizAverage.
    Would it be a good idea to make these changes? Why or why not?

= It's not good idea since we use 5 on programAverage and 10 on quizAverage based on
  the value we give the program and quiz. how about the teacher/instructor/somebody
  assess using different value
