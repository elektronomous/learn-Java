Identify and fix the errors in the following code

public class Test {
    public void main(string[] args) {
        double i = 50.0;
        double k = i + 50.0;
        double j = k + 1;
        System.out.println("j is " + j + " and
        k is " + k);
    }
}

(answer): whenever you feel that's the line isn't enough
          you can add it by enclosed the current double quotes
          and adding plus symbol "+" and create new string.
          
    System.out.println("j is " + j + " and " +
                         "k is " + k);
