Translate the following algorithm into Java code:
(1) Declare a double variable named miles with an initial value 100
(2) Declare a double constant named KILOMETERS_PER_MILE with value 1.609;
(3) Declare a variable named kilometers, multiply miles and KILOMETERS_PER_MILE
    and assign the result to kilometers
(4) display kilometers in the console
What is kilometers after step 4?

(answer):

    public class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // (1)
            double miles = 100
            // (2)
            final double KILOMETERS_PER_MILE = 1.609;
            // (3)
            double kilometers = miles * KILOMETERS_PER_MILE;
            // (4)
            System.out.println("The miles in kilometers is " + kilometers + " km");
        }
    }

= 160.9
