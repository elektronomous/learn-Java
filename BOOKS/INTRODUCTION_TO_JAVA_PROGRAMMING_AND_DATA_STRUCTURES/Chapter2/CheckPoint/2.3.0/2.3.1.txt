How do you write a statement to let the user enter a double
value from keyboard? What happens if you entered 5a when executing
the following code

    double radius = input.nextDouble();

(1)
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    double radius = input.nextDouble();

(2) = The program will be terminated and throw an InputMismatchException (runtime
      error)
