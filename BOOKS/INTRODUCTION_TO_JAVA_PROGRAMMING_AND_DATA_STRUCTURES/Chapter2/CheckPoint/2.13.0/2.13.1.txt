How do you obtain the current second, minute and hour?

= we begin from total milli second we get from System.currentTimeMillis()
= we get the total second by dividing by 1000 and we get the current second
  by modulo the total second by 60
= we get the total minute by dividing the total second by 60 and we get the current
  minute by modulo the total minute by 60
= we get the total hour by dividing the total minute by 60 and we get the current hour
  by modulo the total hour by 60


= how does it work ? say that we have 1000 seconds we want to convert it to minutes
  = first we divide it by 60
    
        1000 / 60 = 16
  
  = we don't include the decimal point because we're going to show you the remainder
    part as the current seconds

  = now if you multiply the 16 by 60 you'll get

        16 * 60 = 960

  = and the remainder part 1000 from 960 is 40

        16:40;

  = now you can advance this by current hour and minutes.
