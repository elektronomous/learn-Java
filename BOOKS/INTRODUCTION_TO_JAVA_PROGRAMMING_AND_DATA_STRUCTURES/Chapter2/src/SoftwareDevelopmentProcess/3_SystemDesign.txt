System design is to design a process for obtaining the output from the input. This phase
involves the use of many levels of abstraction to break down the problem into manageable
components and design strategies for implementing each component. You can view each
component as a subsystem that performs a specific function of the system. The essence of
system analysis and design is input, process, and output (IPO).


During system design, you identify the steps in the program.
Step 3.1.   Prompt the user to enter the annual interest rate, the number of years, and the loan
            amount.
            (The interest rate is commonly expressed as a percentage of the principal for a period of
            one year. This is known as the annual interest rate.)

Step 3.2.   The input for the annual interest rate is a number in percent format, such as 4.5%.
            The program needs to convert it into a decimal by dividing it by 100. To obtain
            the monthly interest rate from the annual interest rate, divide it by 12, since a year
            has 12 months. Thus, to obtain the monthly interest rate in decimal format, you
            need to divide the annual interest rate in percentage by 1200. For example, if the
            annual interest rate is 4.5%, then the monthly interest rate is 4.5/1200 = 0.00375.
Step 3.3.   Compute the monthly payment using the preceding formula.

Step 3.4.   Compute the total payment, which is the monthly payment multiplied by 12 and
            multiplied by the number of years.

Step 3.5.   Display the monthly payment and total payment.
