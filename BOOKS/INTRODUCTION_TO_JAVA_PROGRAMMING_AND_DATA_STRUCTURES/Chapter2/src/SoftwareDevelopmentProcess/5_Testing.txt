Testing ensures the code meets the requirements specification and weeds out bugs. An
independent team of software engineers not involved in the design and implementation of the
product usually conducts such testing

After the program is implemented, test it with some sample input data and verify whether the
output is correct. Some of the problems may involve many cases, as you will see in later chapters.
For these types of problems, you need to design test data that cover all cases.
