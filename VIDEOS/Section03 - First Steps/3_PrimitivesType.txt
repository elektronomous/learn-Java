| JAVA PRIMITIVE TYPES |
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.

= In java primitive types are the most basic data types.
= The eight primitive data types in Java are:
  [1] Boolean
  [2] byte
  [3] char
  [4] short
  [5] int
  [6] long
  [7] float
  [8] double

= to know how much int can store in memory
    Integer.MAX_VALUE
    Integer.MIN_VALUE

= This Integer is called wrapper class.
  [=] Using this wrapper class, it gives us ways to perform operations on an int.

= When you try to put a value larger than the maximum value in java, or a value smaller than
  the minimum value in java, then you will get an OVERFLOW in the case of the maximum value
  or an UNDERFLOW in the case of minimum value.
= Java will warning you if you type a value larger than it's data type can hold.
= A Byte occupies 8 bits.
  [=] We say that a byte has a width of 8.
= A short can store a large range of numbers and occupies 16 bits and has a width of 16.
= A integer has much larger range as we know, and occupies 32 bits.
= When you define a value for `long` data type, you need to add letter 'L' after the number you
  write.

            long myLongValue = 100L;

| JAVA PACKAGE |
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.

= A package is a way to organize your Java projects.

        package "Section03 - First Steps".src

= src is the subfolder of the folder Section03 - First Steps.
